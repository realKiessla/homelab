# Longhorn Installation
## Prerequisite
The only thing that had to be installed on our Raspberry PI 4's with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS was the package `nfs-common`.

## Installation
Installation could be done (relatively simple) with the installation instructions: https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/deploy/install/install-with-helm/
